# Sentiment-Analysis-using-Multi-Task-Learning-Keras
A course project for the CSE641 (Deep Learning) course. The aim was to perform transfer learning on the task of sentiment classification
using two datasets - Imdb and Insults in social commentary. Three major approaches were followed: pure self-attention based models (transformers), transfer learning using chain-thaw method and multi-task learning. This repository contains the code for the multi-task learning architecture.
